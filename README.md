A forgotten leaflet with a rustic recipe shocked world science. Former military paramedic Evan Durham was sorting through his archives, and suddenly found an old notebook sheet - from the time of the peacekeeping mission to the Asian jungle. Then the soldiers in his company almost returned home disabled due to an epidemic foot fungus. But a local healer gave him a recipe for a drug that put the fighters on their feet in a couple of weeks. Years later, Mr. Durham created an express antifungal agent based on it, the power of which is already legendary, and pharmaceutical companies are almost fighting for the right to sell it under their own brand.

Is it true that this medication helps to get rid of long-standing fungus in almost 1-2 weeks and eliminates an unpleasant smell for a long time? Let's find out!
Hyperhidrosis and mycosis are the scourge of soldiers and officers. Army shoes are not breathable. And daily exercises and forced marches make soldiers' feet sweat a lot. Over time, a difficult-to-remove fungus develops, the feet are rubbed to bloody calluses, they swell, itch and smell unpleasant. Especially in hot and humid climates. So, in one of the peacekeeping missions to Asia, fungus almost mowed down an entire company of soldiers. Doctors could not cope with weeping ulcers and bloody calluses on the feet of the fighters.

## A folk recipe from the wild jungle quickly put the soldiers on their feet
Fortunately, the locals suggested a recipe for feet diseases. Soldiers lubricated their feet, and soon the fungus epidemic disappeared.

This recipe is based on tincture of thuja, neem and tea tree oil. In the right proportions, these components:
Reduce foot sweating
Destroy fungus
Care for your skin
Deodorize
Dry
Protect your shoes
In his private lab, Evan Durham decided to enhance this remedy by combining an ancient recipe with modern technology. He supplemented the recipe with a native plant, Larrea tridentis, a powerful antifungal component. That's how Foot Trooper - Spray appeared - an express remedy against foot sweating and fungus.

**Official comment from the developer of Foot Trooper, Evan Durham**
Evan Durham, creator of Foot Trooper spray
In the army, I personally saw what the fungus does to the feet of soldiers: they rotted, covered with ulcers, bled. This recipe saved our fighters. Now I have improved its composition. The effectiveness of the spray exceeded all expectations. Foot Trooper not just dries the skin and heals cracks and calluses. It breaks down the protein structure of the fungus , and also DISINFECTS THE SKIN AND NAILS FROM ITS SPORES. I am proud that Foot Trooper has become the first natural remedy that will help you forget about fungal infection and hyperhidrosis in 1-2 weeks.

# Why is Foot Trooper that effective?

The active components of the spray create a protective layer on the skin in which the fungus simply cannot live and multiply - even in the tightest and most uncomfortable shoes.

Foot Trooper disinfects and destroys the structure of a fungal infection, eliminates itching, discomfort, accelerates the healing of wounds and cracks. Due to its high penetrating ability, it reduces the amount of sweat produced. Also, this spray strengthens the nail plate, moisturizes and pleasantly refreshes the skin due to natural antiseptics and a powerful vitamin base.

**Foot Trooper operates in 4 directions:**
Relieves excessive sweating of the feet;
Freezes and destroys fungus cells;
Provides a combined effect on tissues affected by fungal spores: stops the growth of colonies, destroys adults, relieves inflammation, disinfects, softens and restores damaged skin, including the nail plate;
Due to the cooling effect, it quickly removes the symptoms of fungus - itching, peeling, feeling of dryness and tightness of the skin.

# There remains only one question: why is such an effective and simple drug still not sold in pharmacies?

As soon as scientists learned about Foot Trooper, well-known medical brands started offering their services to Mr. Durham. But he refused to work with them. The fact is that he developed the product for casual people. And under a well-known brand, such a spray would cost a lot of money. Evan Durham's team decided that they would not cooperate with pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy chains and implemented Foor Trooper on their own. Thanks to this policy, the fungus super spray is now available to everyone.
